Project Overview
AI_Trading_System_ki is an advanced trading platform solely owned by Khaleq Salehi. It leverages reinforcement learning (RL), natural language processing (NLP), and real-time market data to execute optimized trading strategies. The system features a modular architecture, ensuring plug-and-play components, robust security, and compatibility with Windows and VPS environments. It includes a responsive Dash-based dashboard, smart VPN switching, and an external REST API for remote control. Qwen has contributed to code development and provided architectural guidance.
Features

Modular Architecture: Clean folder structure with dedicated modules for strategies, UI, APIs, logs, models, and utilities.
Self-Learning AI: Reinforcement learning for adaptive strategy optimization, supported by backtesting (backtester.py) and market replay (market_replay.py).
Exchange API Integration: Smart failover for reliable connections to crypto and forex exchanges, configurable via UI.
Responsive Dashboard: Built with Dash, featuring real-time logs, stats, strategy settings, market data, and VPN status.
Sentiment Analysis: NLP-driven news and sentiment analysis using HuggingFace models, NLTK, and VADER.
Smart VPN Module: Automatic server switching for V2Ray/VPN connections, with status displayed in the UI.
Security: Encrypted API keys and optimized performance for low-latency trading.
External API: REST endpoints (e.g., /pause, /status, /retrain) for remote system control.

Roadmap

Phase 1 (Q3 2025): Implement basic backtesting, one trading strategy, and exchange API integration.
Phase 2 (Q4 2025): Develop Dash dashboard and lightweight NLP sentiment analysis.
Phase 3 (Q1 2026): Integrate RL for strategy optimization and smart VPN module.
Phase 4 (Q2 2026): Add external REST API and optimize for production-scale performance.

Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.11
Windows or VPS environment
Offline Python packages in E:\Programing\pyton\pack (or download from non-sanctioned sources like https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple)

Steps

Clone the Repository (requires permission from Khaleq Salehi):git clone https://github.com/khalegh2131/AI_Trading_System_ki.git
cd AI_Trading_System_ki


Set Up Virtual Environment:python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
If using offline packages:pip install --no-index --find-links=E:\Programing\pyton\pack -r requirements.txt


If online, use non-sanctioned mirrors.


Configure Settings:
Edit config.yaml to set API keys, exchange pairs, and VPN subscription links.


Run the Application (only with explicit permission):python app.py



Usage

Launch the dashboard: python dashboard_main.py
Configure trading strategies and API connections via the UI.
Run backtests using backtester.py or simulate with market_replay.py.
Monitor real-time logs, stats, and VPN status in the dashboard.
Control the system remotely via REST API (e.g., POST /pause).

Note: Usage of this system in any form requires explicit permission from Khaleq Salehi.
Dependencies
Key dependencies (see requirements.txt for full list):

dash: Responsive dashboard
pandas: Data manipulation
numpy: Numerical operations
requests: API connections
huggingface_hub: NLP models
nltk: Sentiment analysis
vaderSentiment: Sentiment scoring
pyyaml: Configuration parsing
pytest: Unit testing
